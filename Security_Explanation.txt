SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS IN DOCKER DEPLOYMENT

1. IMPORTANCE OF .GITIGNORE FOR .ENV FILES
- .env files contain sensitive information (passwords, API keys, credentials)
- If not ignored, credentials could be exposed in version control


2. RISKS OF EXPOSING CREDENTIALS
- Unauthorized database access
- Service compromise
- Data breaches
- Financial implications if API keys are exposed
- Potential for malicious use of cloud services

3. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never commit .env files to git
